 - installs mininet, python-ryu, stunnel, openvswitch;
 - enables and starts openvswitch

How to run:

1. Launch ryu controller
Make sure that correct channels.json present in current folder (otherwise default file /var/lib/qcrypt/channels.json will be used.

sample code is in ryu folder and can be launched using:
ryu-manager --verbose ryu.app.ofctl_rest ryu.app.qcrypt

2. run mininet 

python mininet-qnet.py config-file.py

 - initializes all hosts with IP's in 10.0.0.0/24 network
 - starts sshd for each host  (one can ssh to each host for debugging)
 - starts stunnel, netcat and qcrypt according to configuration at 
https://github.com/itmo-infocom/qnet/blob/master/doc/network.png
nodes renubered from (1,3,4,5,2) to (1,2,3,4,5)

3. launch tests
sh test-mux.sh

in case of abnormal termination run:
sh run_muxers.sh stop
